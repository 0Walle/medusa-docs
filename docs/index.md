# Medusa Documentation

## Introduction

Medusa is a language made for pure fun. This is a small documentation for its test versions. Weird things might happen.

## Quick Reference

If you are here you are problably already a programmer, The [Quick reference](quick_ref.md) will show the features of the language in a more direct way.

## Getting Started

### Hello, World!

As always:

```
fn main(){
    println("Hello, World!");
}
```

Compiling and running this program should print `Hello, World!`, if it doesn't, then something is really wrong.

### Now what?

Now lets understand what's going on here.

Every Medusa program starts with a `main` function. Like this:

```mds
fn main(){

}
```

Then inside the function there is the line:

```mds
    println("Hello, World!");
```

This line calls the function `println` with the argument `"Hello, World!"` which is a string and prints it in the console.

## Tutorial (Incomplete)

The [Tutorial](tutorial.md) will show the features of the language in a understandable order.
